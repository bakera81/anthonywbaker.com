        Since 1987, Lafayette's <a href="https://cwp.lafayette.edu/">College Writing Program</a> has required every writing tutor to write a personal essay about their history as a writer.
        This corpus of student writing is an incredibly valuable research datasetâ€”if you can access it easily. For example, a research question my team was interested in is "How has the shift from writing with pen and paper to writing digitally shaped the way students think about their own writing process?"
