# The trap of big deals


#### 2020-04-01

For B2B startups—or startups transitioning to B2B, as was my experience—this will undoubtedly happen: The Big Deal™️ will come along, and unfortunately, you wont close it because you are missing a certain feature or certification. Naturally, it will be tempting to build that feature or spend time and money to get certified.

But the trap of big deals is the concept that in a resource-constrained environment (like most startups), you shouldn't spend your resources building those features or going after that certification _unless_ your business is predicated on big deals. If you're the type of SaaS company that makes most of its revenue from small deals, you need to take them into account when choosing how to prioritize projects—which seems obvious. But it isn’t always so obvious to deprioritize a feature you know a big, potential client wants.

If you consistently prioritize work that you believe will help you close big deals and neglect projects designed to help smaller customers use your product, you'll end up building a product that isn't working for your core audience.

# The cargo cult and “bending over backwards”


#### 2019-11-01

I first heard of this concept when [Dave Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob) shared [Richard Feynman’s 1974 commencement speech at Caltech](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm). There’s a lot to be said about this: for instance, the entire field of epistemology or the scientific method. Good scientists “bend over backward” to compile all of the evidence _against_ the hypothesis they are trying to prove, as well as evidence for it. The idea of bending backwards plus the amazing image of the cargo cult waiting on their island is a great reminder to always be on the lookout for pseudoscience.


# Managing up


#### 2020-04-01

[Jared Silver](https://twitter.com/JaredSilver) introduced this one to me, and the concept immediately clicked. I worked at a company with a lot of first-time managers and a fairly flat organizational structure. If you’ve got a lot of critical thinkers whose work has them interact with different teams across the company, it is inevitable that those people will identify problems or solutions that their managers may not see. There will be times when you have to work together with your manager to accomplish things out of the scope of your own job, and “managing up” is a framework (that a lot of people have written about) to help you do just that.

# SaaS retention as an indicator of P/M fit

I came across this idea from [Brian Balfour’s](https://brianbalfour.com/) [Reforge program](https://brianbalfour.com/courses). How can you tell if your product is providing value to the market, aka that you’ve found the infamous “product market fit?” One way is to look at your retention curves. You expect to see some early dropoff; not everyone you market to is your core audience. But if your curve flattens out, you have some powerful evidence that there is a market out there that is unlocking enough value from your product to keep coming back. If the curve doesn’t flatten out? Time to keep iterating on solving a deep-seated need for your users.

# The value of process

Whatever outcome you are after, process makes it repeatable, scalable, and more likely.



# The wheel of value creation


#### 2019-12-01

I heard of this one from [Weston Stearns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weston-stearns/). He presented this at a company all-hands at a time when focus on solving our users’ needs had taken a backseat. In essence, a company needs to balance three focuses: first, creating as much value for our users as possible; second, monetizing that value; and finally, investing that money to create even more value. It’s all about finding balance within the wheel of value creation. The wheel of value creation in the sky keeps turning.


# Machine learning as translation into N-dimensional space

This is a mile-high, extremely oversimplified view of machine learning, but this idea helped a lot of various machine learning approaches click for me.

You start with very complicated data. You need to distill it down so you can plot it in space. There are all sorts of techniques to do this distillation. Once you can plot your data, you can do all sorts of math magic. There are lots of different types of math magic. The math magic lets you calculate distances and find clusters. Voila!


# Decentralization

The hottest buzzword in VC circa 2015.


# Designing for accessibility

Designing for accessibility isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s a key part of designing great solutions. Accessible solutions benefit everyone. Take curb cutaways: the ramps at the edges of sidewalks originally designed for people in wheelchairs benefit other people too, like moms pushing strollers or delivery people pushing carts. The company OXO started out designing utensils and appliances for senior citizens and people with Arthritis, and ended up making easy-to-use tools that work great for everyone. Designing a mobile app that works great on 3G connections will be lightning fast for someone on LTE or 5G. Designing for your users with the most requirements can help create even better solutions for everyone.
