title: Summer Salad of the Summer (2017)
ingredients:
  - Spinach
  - Cherry tomatoes
  - Roasted, unsalted almonds
  - Fresh little Mozzarella balls
  - Shaved or shredded Parmesan
  - Bacon (get pre-cooked if you don't want to cook a single damn thing)
  - Grilled chicken breast (get it pre-grilled if you don't want to cook a single damn thing)
  - Olive oil
  - Balsamic vinegar
instructions:
  - text: Microwave the bacon just a lil to get the texture right (if precooked). If uncooked bacon, do your thang, then cut into bite-sized pieces.
    protip: I think bacon cooks best in the oven, 425, on a baking sheet with parchment paper.
  - text: If any of the tomatoes are looking a little husky, cut them in half.
  - text: slice the chicken into thin strips.
    protip: Find which direction the grain of the chicken is running, and cut against it. That way, the chicken falls apart easier when you bit it.
  - text: Dice up the almonds a little bit.
  - text: Dump spinach in a bowl.
  - text: arrange each ingredient around the edge, so you have fun little zones to duck into. Sprinkle Parmesan on top.
  - text: Dress to taste with oil + vinegar.
