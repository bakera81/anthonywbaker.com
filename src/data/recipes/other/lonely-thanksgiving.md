title: Poor Anthony's lonely thanksgiving
---

# Ingredients

* Cold-cut turkey
* White bread
* Provolone
* Stovetop instant stuffing
* Cranberry sauce (canned)
* Heinz turkey gravy (in the jar)
* Microwaveable mashed potatoes

# Instructions

1. What you're about to do is make a calorically rich, high-sodium open-faced Thanksgiving ensemble with the cheapest, home-cooked-alternative ingredients that exist.
2. With that in mind, follow the directions for the stuffing. Essentially everything in this recipe can be microwaved. It doesn't matter what order you microwave shit. In fact, nothing matters.
3. Microwave the gravy. Microwave the potatoes. Do whatever you want.
4. Melt the cheese on the bread. I don't care how you do it. Microwave it for all I care.
5. Eat what you've just made, and try not to think too much. Try not to think about why you're alone, or how the smell of roasting turkey reminds you of home, or the cockroach that you left under a glass bowl because deep down you were too afraid to deal with it like a man.
6. Enjoy!
