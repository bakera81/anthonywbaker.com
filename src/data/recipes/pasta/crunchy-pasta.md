title: Crunchy Pasta with Chicken, Ricotta, Broccoli, and Lemon
---

# Ingredients

* 1/2 box of pasta (preferably a big tubular shape)
* 1/2 lb chicken tenderloins (or "stir-fry" chicken)
* Broccoli
* 1 big lemon (or 2 small lemons)
* Crushed red pepper flakes
* Salt
* Black pepper
* Cumin seeds
* Olive oil
* 1/3 cup of unseasoned Panko bread crumbs
* 1/3 grated parmesan
* Whole milk Ricotta
  Pro Tip™️: Make sure it is good Ricotta. If it has more than three ingredients, ditch it—it won't melt properly.

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400.
2. Quarter each chicken tenderloin. If you went with the "stir-fry" chicken, skip this step.
    Pro Tip™️: Do not drop the chicken into the oil. It will splash on you. Don't burn your hands from leaping boiling oil droplets. Good luck.
3. Heat ~0.5 cm of oil in a skillet. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and season with salt and pepper.
4. As the chicken is frying, begin boiling water for the pasta.
5. Toss the broccoli in a bowl with olive oil, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, and not-too-many cumin seeds.
6. Spread the broccoli on a baking sheet. Cover the sheet with tinfoil beforehand if you don't want to wash it after this.
7. Bake for about 20 minutes until soft and the edges are just starting to turn brown.
8. Flip the chicken about halfway so it cooks evenly. It should be golden-brown on each side.
9. Flip the broccoli after 10 minutes or so.
10. Don't forget about the pasta.
11. Begin zesting your lemon(s) as finely as possible. You'll want a tablespoon of zest.
12. Mix 1/3 cup of parmesan, 1/3 cup Panko bread crumbs, a little salt and pepper, and your zest.
13. When the broccoli is done, switch the oven to broil.
14. When the chicken is done, place it on a soft bed of paper towels to soak up any excess oil. You have cooked it too long when the oil starts smoking.
15. Add the chicken and pasta to the baking sheet with their broccoli friends.
16. Dollop with Ricotta. You like Ricotta.
17. Sprinkle your magic breadcrumb mixture on top.
18. Give it a hearty drizzle of olive oil.
19. Broil for a couple minutes to perfection.
    Pro Tip™️: You've come so far! Don't fuck it up now! Don't overbroil!
20. Serve with a good squeeze of lemon.
21. Enjoy a delicious meal. I'm happy for you.
