- text: Broccoli
- text: 1 big lemon (or 2 small lemons)
- text: Crushed red pepper flakes
- text: Salt
- text: Black pepper
- text: Cumin seeds
- text: Olive oil
- text: 1/3 cup of unseasoned Panko bread crumbs
- text: 1/3 grated parmesan
- protip: "Pro Tip\u2122: Make sure it is good Ricotta. If it has more than three\
    \ ingredients, ditch it\u2014it won't melt properly"
  text: Whole milk Ricotta
instructions:
- text: Preheat the oven to 400.
- text: Quarter each chicken tenderloin. If you went with the "stir-fry" chicken,
    skip this step.
- protip: "Pro Tip\u2122: Do not drop the chicken into the oil\u2014it will splash\
    \ on you\u2014 and don't burn your hands from leaping boiling oil droplets. Good\
    \ luck."
  text: Heat ~0.5 cm of oil in a skillet. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and
    season with salt and pepper.
- text: As the chicken is frying, begin boiling water for the pasta.
- text: Toss the broccoli in a bowl with olive oil, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper,
    and not-too-many cumin seeds.
- text: Spread the broccoli on a baking sheet. Cover the sheet with tinfoil beforehand
    if you don't want to wash it after this.
- text: Bake for about 20 minutes until soft and the edges are just starting to turn
    brown.
- text: Flip the chicken about halfway so it cooks evenly. It should be golden-brown
    on each side.
- text: Flip the broccoli after 10 minutes or so.
- text: Don't forget about the pasta.
- protip: "Pro Tip\u2122: use a microplane grater, it will be easier to clean."
  text: Begin zesting your lemon(s) as finely as possible. You'll want a tablespoon
    of zest.
- protip: "Pro Tip\u2122: Don't spill the magic mixture all over the kitchen, it's\
    \ a real pain."
  text: Mix 1/3 cup of parmesan, 1/3 cup Panko bread crumbs, a little salt and pepper,
    and your zest.
- text: When the broccoli is done, switch the oven to broil.
- text: When the chicken is done, place it on a soft bed of paper towels to soak up
    any excess oil. You have cooked it too long when the oil starts smoking.
- text: Add the chicken and pasta to the baking sheet with their broccoli friends.
- text: Dollop with Ricotta. You like Ricotta.
- text: Spinkle your magic breadcrumb mixture on top.
- text: Give it a hearty drizzle of olive oil.
- protip: "Pro Tip\u2122: You've come so far! Don't fuck it up now! Don't overbroil!"
  text: Broil for a couple minutes to perfection.
- text: Serve with a good squeeze of lemon.
- text: Enjoy a delicious meal. I'm happy for you.
