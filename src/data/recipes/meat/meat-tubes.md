---

# Ingredients

* Hot dogs
  + Pro Tip\u2122: Martin's potato rolls are the way to go.
* Hot dog rolls
* Pickles
* Onion
* Spicy brown mustard
* Tabasco

# Instructions

1. Throw the dogs onto a frying pan on medium-high heat.
2. Quickly dice part of the onion\u2014hurry, you only have 60 seconds, so don't slice more than you need.
3. Roll the dogs around on the pan, watching in pleasure as at least two sides
    of their taught pink skin turn an even, golden tan.
4. Pro Tip\u2122: by using whole pickles and slicing them yourself, you control the pickle-to-meat-tube ratio.
5. If you have whole pickles, slice one into spears and lay them into the rolls.
6. Grab the meat tubes and nestle them into the waiting pre-picked potato rolls.
7. Complete the ensemble with a sprinkling of onion, a healthy squirt of spicy brown, and several shakes of tabasco.
