title: Happy sausage surprise for one
---

# Ingredients

* 3 sweet Italian sausages
* 2 tallboys of "sausage beer", i.e. 'Gansett, PBR, High Life, etc.
* 1 green bell pepper
* 1 large Spanish onion
* Pro Tip\u2122: If you cannot find 1 large Spanish onion:
* 2 smaller Spanish onions

# Instructions

 1. Slice the pepper and onion.
 2. Lightly oil a large pan.
 3. Dump pepper / onion into the large pan on low heat.
 4. Saut\xE9e for until pepper / onion begin to soften.
 5. Dump the sausage into the large pan.
 6. Open a beer and begin drinking it.
 7. Whenever the pan looks like it is starting to lose moisture, gently waterfall
    some beer onto your sausage friends.
 8. Occasionally, roll the sausages around.
 9. Pro Tip\u2122: Sometimes, I make a little dam out of the pepper / onions to contain the beer around the sausages. It is like a little hot tub for them!
 10. Continue this process for 20-30 minutes, until the sausages are thoroughly cooked.
 11. Pro Tip\u2122: Depending on the rate that you are drinking the beer, you may need multiple cans.
 12. Stuff the sausage, peppers, and onions into a toasted, sliced ciabatta roll
    and garnish with Frank's Red Hot.
