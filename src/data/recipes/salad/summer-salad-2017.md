title: Summer Salad of the Summer (2017)

# Ingredients:

* Spinach
* Cherry tomatoes
* Roasted, unsalted almonds
* Fresh little Mozzarella balls
* Shaved or shredded Parmesan
* Bacon (get pre-cooked if you don't want to cook a single damn thing)
* Grilled chicken breast (get it pre-grilled if you don't want to cook a single damn thing)
* Olive oil
* Balsamic vinegar

# Instructions

1. Microwave the bacon just a lil to get the texture right (if precooked). If uncooked bacon, do your thang, then cut into bite-sized pieces.
    Pro Tip™️: I think bacon cooks best in the oven, 425, on a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. If any of the tomatoes are looking a little husky, cut them in half.
3. slice the chicken into thin strips.
    Pro Tip™️: Find which direction the grain of the chicken is running, and cut against it. That way, the chicken falls apart easier when you bite it.
4. Dice up the almonds a little bit.
5. Dump spinach in a bowl.
6. Arrange each ingredient around the edge, so you have fun little zones to duck into. Sprinkle parmesan on top.
7. Dress to taste with oil + vinegar.
