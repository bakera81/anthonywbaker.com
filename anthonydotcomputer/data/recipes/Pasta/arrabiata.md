# Ingredients

  * Olive oil
  * Fresh garlic
  * 2 boxes of Campari tomatoes (about 20 little tomatoes)
  * 1 bundle Italian parsley
  * Dried red chiles
    + Pro Tip™️: Crushed red pepper flakes are fine. They typically have less spice variance than whole dried chiles.
  * Pasta
    + Pro Tip™️: the best shapes of pasta for this, in order, are 1. Orrichette 2. Penne 2.5. Bucatini 3. Rigatoni 4. Shells.
  * Parmesan cheese (shaved)

# Instructions

1. Peel the garlic.
    Pro Tip™️: I cut the pointy ends off then make a shallow incision from one end to the other. With a little pressure, you can get most of the skin off in one attempt.
2. Slice the garlic thin. You'll want about 6 small cloves' worth.
3. Cut / crush the chiles into very small pieces. If using crushed red pepper, skip this step.
4. Rinse then quarter (literally, cut into quarters) all of the little Campari tomatoes.
5. Heartily pour oil into a large pan or wok. I use a skillet for this. You'll want a little more than will cover the bottom of the pan.
    Pro Tip™️: whatever pan/wok you use, make sure it has a decently thick bottom to avoid burning anything.
6. Dump red pepper/chiles into the oil and heat on low. After a bit, add the garlic. If using crushed red pepper, you'll want to use enough to pretty much completely cover the oil.
7. Sauté the garlic for only a few minutes (3 minutes) until there's a little action. If the garlic starts to turn brown, you're fucked.
8. Dump all of the tomato quarters into the mix.
9. Pick the leaves off of the stems of the parsley. You'll want almost half the leaves. Don't worry, you have plenty of time.
10. Sprinkle a healthy pinch of the parsley into the steaming tomato mixture.
11. Continue simmering on low heat, stirring occasionally, for about an hour (it's a labor of love).
12. When the tomatoes have disintegrated and are now sauce-like, begin cooking the pasta.
13. Add the rest of the parsley to the sauce. If you got distracted while picking the leaves and it looks like too much parsley, don't be an idiot, leave some out.
14. When the pasta is done (erring on the side of undercooked), drain it then dump it onto a fresh frying pan.
15. Add 1-2 ladles of sauce onto the pasta and toss in the frying pan on medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes. You want the smallest amount of sauce to essentially coat all the pasta.
    Pro Tip™️: This really enhances the texture of the pasta and gets a good coating of sauce all up in there.
16. The time has come: serve your pasta with a dollop of sauce on top, a few healthy pinches Parmesan, then, if you're trying to impress anyone, garnish with a whole parsley leaf or two.
