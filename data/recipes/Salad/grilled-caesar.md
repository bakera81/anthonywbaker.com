title: Grilled Caesar
---

# Ingredients

- Romaine hearts
- Caesar dressing
- Olive oil
- Parmesan
- Lemon juice
- Sea salt (big crystals)
- Black pepper
- Croutons

# Instructions

1. Heat the grill—if you should be so fortunate to have access to a grill.
2. Halve the romaine hearts.
3. Drizzle olive oil on the freshly halved romaine.
4. Place the romaine on the grill, face down. It should only take a minute to give them a char—we're not trying to cook the lettuce for Christ's sake.
5. Remove the romaine from the grill, hit 'em with the dressing, sea salt, lemon juice, heck, even the croutons.
6. Voila.
