This site is powered by Gatsby.js.

## Quick start

1. `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
2. `npm i`
3. `gatsby develop`

## Deploy
1. Commit to the `prod` branch to trigger a new build on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/teams/bakera81/overview).

## Notes
1. It may be worthwhile to follow [this guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/image-migration-guide/#codemod-instructions) and replace anywhere I use `useStaticQuery` with `StaticImage`.
